# R-OBJ
Red's Object Format (ROBJ) and Red's Motion Object Format (R-MOBJ); a smaller, faster version of the OBJ format.
Currently made for my small projects, but may end up being more.

This repository is intended to include:
- [ ] A Compressor CLI
- [ ] A Single Object Loader Header/File
- [ ] Tests Running animations for R-MOBJ format
